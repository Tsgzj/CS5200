For out project, we've devided to design and develop a e-economy system. There are four types of users, Customers, Inventry Manager, Payment Manager and delivery manager. Customers can view, search, order and make comments of some items which are posted by inventry managers. Inventry managers can add, delete or modify items. Delivery managers are in charge of delivery, who will report whether an order is delivered or not. Finally, the role of payment managers is to assert if the customers' payment info are correct.

Customers will be able to view all the information online.
